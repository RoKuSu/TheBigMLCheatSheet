"# This is a Big ML CheatSheet both in Python & R" 
Projects & datsets included:
1. Salary prediction using Linear Regression
2. Future profit or revenue prediction using Multivariate Regression
3. Salary Bluff or not prediction using Polynomial Regression, Support vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression & Random forest regression
Note: Random Forest Regression will give the best results since its an ensemble of multiple decision trees but if you want to save computing power & computing time polynomial regression is better than decision tree regression.
4. Purchasing Behaviour or purchasing likeliness Prediction using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Random Forests
5. Mall customer clustering using K-Means Clustering & Heirarchical Clustering
6. Market Basket Optimization using Eclat & Apriori algorithm for Association Rule miming
7. Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews through NLP
8. Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis using deep learning (NN) & XGBoost
9. Cat & Dog Image Recognition using Convolutional Networks

Bonus Codes on:
